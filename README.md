# arduino_blink_java

This project uses serial connection through Java's library jSerialComm to turn on/off and make a led blink.
Very easy project with potential to increase its features.

Requirements:
JAVA 1.8 or higher
jSerialComm library added to path dependency and/or pom.xml
Arduino Board (Uno or Mega)
Serial Cable

How to run:
1. Connect your Arduino with led already setup to your Pc/Mac
   and checkout its IO port (COM-Windows) or (/dev/ttyXXX - Linux/Mac) name.
3. Run the C file in Arduino IDE found in "/led_arduino".
4. Put the port I/O device name in the Arduino.class and if necessary change bound rates.
6. Compile or run the program in your favourite IDE
7. Have fun !
